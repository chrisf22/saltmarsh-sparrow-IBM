###This code is for a brute-force, single-population simulation that estimates extinction risk for Saltmarsh Sparrows by projecting tide height for 80 years (Y). The simulation uses parallel computing to run Q iterations for quantifying the range of parameter uncertainty. It is also possible to partition environmental and demographic stochasticity by specifying a number other than 1 for E. The loop for E runs within each iteration for Q, giving the enviro/demo uncertainty for a single vector of values of the simulation's parameters. 

#water level units are in ft above MSL to be consistent with NOAA tidal constituents
#all years are nonleap years, but this does not matter for population simulations because the season always starts on May 1 (it does matter for projecting tides heights using tidal constituents)

start_time <- proc.time()

###CHECK THE FOLLOWING CONDITIONS BEFORE RUNNNG###
#number of iterations for each loop: E is demographic-environmental uncertainty (not necessary unless specifically partitioning the uncertainty); Y is the number of years; Q is the number of iterations for estimating uncertainty from parameter estimation
E <- 1
Y <-  80
Q <-1000
#make sure the correct working directories are selected
